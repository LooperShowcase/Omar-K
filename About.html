    <h1>The famous story of Ronaldo</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cristiano was knocked down by his father’s comments and overwhelmed with
      memories of growing up with an alcoholic father who died when Cristiano
      was 20. He regretted they never really had a proper conversation, he
      explained, and that his father didn’t live long enough to see Cristiano
      rise to fame or share in the joy of his awards. “My father, he saw
      nothing. He died young. But it is what it is,” Cristiano said, wiping away
      tears. Arguably the greatest footballer on earth (his rivalry with Lionel
      Messi is the stuff of legend), Cristiano still wonders if his success was
      due to his father watching over him from heaven. While his home life was
      far from perfect, it was José Dinis Aveiro who introduced Cristiano to
      football - known as soccer in America - and guided him to become the man
      he is today. Cristiano Ronaldo is not just competitive and driven, but
      also anxious to improve the world for the sake of his six children and
      those he touches through his work with Save the Children and other
      charities.
