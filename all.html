<h1>The famous story of Ronaldo</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  Cristiano was knocked down by his father’s comments and overwhelmed with
  memories of growing up with an alcoholic father who died when Cristiano
  was 20. He regretted they never really had a proper conversation, he
  explained, and that his father didn’t live long enough to see Cristiano
  rise to fame or share in the joy of his awards. “My father, he saw
  nothing. He died young. But it is what it is,” Cristiano said, wiping away
  tears. Arguably the greatest footballer on earth (his rivalry with Lionel
  Messi is the stuff of legend), Cristiano still wonders if his success was
  due to his father watching over him from heaven. While his home life was
  far from perfect, it was José Dinis Aveiro who introduced Cristiano to
  football - known as soccer in America - and guided him to become the man
  he is today. Cristiano Ronaldo is not just competitive and driven, but
  also anxious to improve the world for the sake of his six children and
  those he touches through his work with Save the Children and other
  charities.
